      <h3>Tuesday: Hack'n'Tech'n'Startup Party</h3>

      <p>After a awesome hackathon and conference day have two gig's: <a href="#afaik">As Fake as I Know</a> and <a href="#academies">academies</a>. We're also featuring two gigs. One of them is <a href="#academies">academies</a> and <a href="#afaik">As Fake As I Know</a>.

      <h3><a href="#afaik" name="afaik">Gig I: As Fake As I Know</a></h3>
      <p>As Fake As I know are from Cologne, or better said from the famous dance school "At the Bickys". After the end of the band "Sugoy" and the disappearances of their favourite "DÃ¶nerbuden", Elboat (guitar, lead singer), Mo (drums) and Teemow (bass) didn't become melancholic, but still wanted to keep it up. In 2009 Claas (keyboards) and Tante Boris (guitar, lead singer) joind the band, so their disco-indie-polka-music-mix made people even more dance!</p>
