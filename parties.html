		<h4><a href="#malte" name="malte">Malte Griesgram</a></h4>
		<p>Right after the Webmonday Malte Griesgram will be our first act. Just a Guitar and a voice - that's all Malte von Griesgram needs to captivate his audience. The 29-year-old sings about bigger and smaller disasters of everyday life, often slightly melancholic, but never without a twinkle in his eye.. He took his first musical steps together with his band Griesgram. In 2010 he released his first solo album "Das kleine Schwarze". Since then he performed more than 30 solo concerts and is touring whenever it's possible...</p>
		<p>Malte von Griesgram is starting a new band for his next record. His first draft is Alex Meyer-Köring, who also plays guitar in Tobey Trueblood from Cologne. They'll present a bunch of new and new arranged songs for the first time together on stage.</p>

		<p>After an awesome hacking and conference day we have two gigs: <a href="#afaik">As Fake as I Know</a> and <a href="#academies">academies</a>.
    <hr />
		<h4><a href="#afaik" name="afaik">Gig I: As Fake As I Know</a></h4>
		<p>As Fake As I know are from Cologne, or better said from the famous dance school "At the Bickys". After the end of the band "Sugoy" and the disappearances of their favorite "Dönerbuden", Elboat (guitar, lead singer), Mo (drums) and Teemow (bass) didn't become melancholic, but still wanted to keep it up. In 2009 Claas (keyboards) and Tante Boris (guitar, lead singer) joined the band, so their disco-indie-polka-music-mix made people even more dance!</p>
		<p>
			Timo, bass<br/>
			Elmar, guitar<br/>
			Moritz, drums<br/>
			Claas, keyboard<br/>
			Peter, lead singer
