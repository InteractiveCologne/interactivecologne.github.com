        <h2>Design Fiction – On Design, Science, Fact and Fiction</h2>
        <p>As William Gibson said "The future is already here — it's just not very evenly distributed." Let me point out that other thinkers like McLuhan suffer also from a mixed-up time sense. In 1967 McLuhan said he believes the future has already happened or to be more specific "most people can see thru the rearview mirror". So as it appears he already thought total automation is upon us, that the whole world is linked as “global village” by TV, that even space travel is now a reality.
        Ultimately, science-fiction author Daniel Suarez may have the best assessment of what’s going on. His two-part novel Daemon and Freedom shows precisely what the power of the internet could do, if harnessed and exploited by someone who truly understands how virtual and actual reality intermesh. That was one of the reasons that motivated me to pick up five of his visions which I would like to share with you.</p>
