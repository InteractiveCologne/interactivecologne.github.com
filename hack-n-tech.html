				<h3><a name="nodecopter" href="#nodecopter">Nodecopter Hack Track (Summer of Drones)</a></h3>
				<p><a href="http://summerofdrones.com">The Summer of Drones</a> is an epic series of up to 34 <a href="http://nodecopter.com/">Nodecopter</a> community events to take place in North America and Europe from June to September 2013.</p>
				<p>Our goal is to highlight the non-military potential of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle">UAVs</a>, bring together people from different programming communities, and learn some interesting new stuff while having fun with flying robots.</p>
				<p>Have a look at some videos from the first Nodecopter event that was held in Berlin on Oct 5th, 2012 to get an idea for what to expect:</p>

				<h3><a name="railsgirls" href="#railsgirls">Rails Girls Cologne</a></h3>
				<p>The aim of RailsGirls is to give tools and a community for women to understand technology and to build their ideas. This is done by providing a great experience on building things and by making technology more approachable.</p>
				<p>Learn sketching, prototyping, basic programming and get introduced to the world of technology. Rails Girls was born in Finland, but is nowadays a global, non-profit volunteer community.</p>

				<h3><a name="music" href="#music">Music Hack Days</a></h3>
				<p>Everybody loves music. We also love hacks. That's why Interactive Cologne wants to connect the music community with developers and creative minds to develop new digital music hacks and applications. Over the last decades the music industry has struggled to create a sufficient and contemporary way to provide/distribute music in the digital space. These days streaming services and digital data make the access to music easier than ever before. <em>Now it's our time to think one step further.... Join us and let's start to build the future of music.</em></p>

				<h3><a href="3dprinting" href="#3dprinting">3D Printing Hack</a></h3>
				<p>3D printers have been around since the 80s but till a few years ago they were exclusively reserved for the industry (due to the high acquisition costs). Along with cheaper open hardware printers like the RepRap printer, the Ultimaker MakerBots or the slightly younger Ultimaker, 3D printers spreaded in the hacker and maker szene and were continually developed. From these open hardware projects commercial supplier of 3D printer kits emerged and even the more expensive industrial equipment manufacturers now offer affordable models. In short: with 400 € and some time you can have your own 3D printer.</p>
				<p>For a long time now we (Garagelab in Dusseldorf and the Dingfabrik in Cologne) deal with open hardware printers and we have come up against a problem: The software for the printers is much less user-friendly than it could be. We would like to change that together with you on the Interactive Cologne event!</p>
				<p>We aim to create a multi-platform user interface, based on the new and yet not very advanced open source project RepetierHost and the slicing software skeinforge. This should help 3D printing newcomers get going, provides regular users with a good workflow and allows professionals a comfortable access to all important parameters.</p>
				<p>Content:
					<ul>
						<li>Introduction of ​​FDM printers using the example of Orca 0.42</li>
						<li>Explanation of the steps from model to printing, based on RepetierHost and skeinforge and the current state of software</li>
						<li>Development of a user interfaces with more user comfort and better user experience</li>
						<li>Implementation and upload in Git</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>Target Group:
					<ul>
						<li>3D printing newbies who want to learn the technique</li>
						<li>3D printing advancer and IT professionals who want to improve the user-friendliness of the software</li>
						<li>UserInterface- and UserExperience-Designer</li>
						<li>Coder and hardware hacker</li>
					</ul>

				<h3><a name="seriousgames" href="#seriousgames">City Serious Games SpotOn Hack</a></h3>
				<p>We want to use digital technology, to "modify places". Simple modifications including sensors, displays, sounds and whatever devices we want to use to put fun into places and things. The idea is, to shape thoughts or give meaning to places, by "gamify" the places. The City Serious Games are hacks, that utilize technology and "game items" to shape and design the interaction between people and places. One goal is to heighten awareness, for example to avoid waste, make places safer or shape new interactions between people.</p>
				<p>The hack-track will give answers to some of the following questions:
					<ol>
						<li>How can we add "fun" into digital technology stuff?</li>
						<li>What is a meaningful interaction between people and objects?</li>
						<li>How can a system be designed, that makes sense as a minimal game system?</li>
						<li>How can tangible technology enable new kinds of interaction?</li>
					</ol>
				</p>
				<p>This hack-track will bridge disciplines like game design, game development, technology hacking, street art, art games and human-machine interaction. It is mostly about adding a "game design / fun perspective" into technology hacks.</p>

				<h3><a name="opendata" href="#opendata">Open Data Hack</a></h3>
				<h4>Apps and the City Cologne</h4>
				<p>What can you do with public transport data when it is open and accessible for everyone? What tools, visualizations and apps could be created using local transport data? How could open transport data help improve and simplify not just customer services of public transport companies but also citizens everyday live?</p>
				<p>To explore these and similar questions in an local context and to create answers using code, the Open Knowledge Foundation in Germany, together with other open transport activists, invites to the Apps and the City Hack Track at Interactive Cologne.</p>
				<p>Within the scope of this event public transport datasets and problems will be adapted and prototypically implemented by interested hackers and software developers. With the help of those prototypes and forward-looking concepts the potential of open data shall be demonstrated and further development initiated.</p>
				<p>All required information and open data will be available online in the near future via <a href="#" title="Apps and the City Cologne">http://cologne.appsandthecity.net</a></p>

				<h3><a name="smallhardware" href="#smallhardware">Small Hardware Hack Tracks</a></h3>
				<h4>Anykey0x</h4>
				<p>Matthias and Tim, makers of Anykey0x.de, will be around to facilitate interaction with the physical world using their tiny ARM Cortex M3 development board, made in Cologne. They’ll premiere their latest, even smaller, Anykey0x revision at Interactive Cologne.</p>
				<p>They’ve got some of their own projects planned, but will be bringing Anykeys, various soldering and hacking tools, a CNC router, expertise and boxes of electronic junk to help the other projects blink, move, make noise and do all sorts of magic. You can bring your own stuff, work on your projects and discuss them. You can participate with their projects (which will focus on the blinking­moving­noisy­magic aspect). Or you can just hang around with them to drink beer (and try to convince them to do something completely different, if it sounds like fun).</p>
				<p><em>Anykey0x is a tiny, cheap, simple but very powerful microcontroller board, allowing to build various sensing and controlling applications ­ standalone, connected by wire or wirelessly to other machines. "It's just like Arduino ... only better."</em>
