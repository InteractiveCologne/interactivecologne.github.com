			<p>C'n'B – Creativity & Business Convention is a forum where decision-makers, thinkers and generators from the creative industries’ entertainment sectors meet. The two-day event invites experienced experts and startups, company founders and dedicated freelancers, creative people and business pros, university graduates and students, to discuss future formats for production, financing and exploitation, new life and business models, new trends and visions. C'n'B offers creative people a home and an action platform - instead of passive consumption, our agenda involves active participation, and creative interaction.</p>
