			<h3>About Webmonday</h3>
			<p>Webmonday is an informal and completely community- driven event that aims to connect people who are shaping the future of the internet. Inspired by the culture of Silicon Valley, it started out in Cologne, Germany in late 2005 in an effort to help spread those sunny California vibes.
Web Monday is followed by an afterparty with local bands and DJs!</p>
			<p>After our talks we have two gig's: <a href="#afaik">As Fake as I Know</a> and <a href="#academies">academies</a>.</p>

			<h3><a href="#afaik" name="afaik">Gig I: As Fake As I Know</a></h3>
			<p>As Fake As I know are from Cologne, or better said from the famous dance school "At the Bickys". After the end of the band "Sugoy" and the disappearances of their favourite "Dönerbuden", Elboat (guitar, lead singer), Mo (drums) and Teemow (bass) didn't become melancholic, but still wanted to keep it up. In 2009 Claas (keyboards) and Tante Boris (guitar, lead singer) joind the band, so their disco-indie-polka-music-mix made people even more dance!</p>
